# giftingapp
This is an app used for ordering a gift customised based on the customers preferences 

This is a simple command line application for ordering gifts. It asks the user for the occasion, recipient age and gender then suggests gifts from a predefined list. After selecting an item the user can enter shipping details and a dummy payment number to complete the order.

## Usage

Run the application with Python:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The program will interactively prompt for the required information and display an order confirmation at the end.
